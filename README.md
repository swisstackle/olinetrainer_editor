Desktop Application to create plays for the Offensive Line Simulation.

YOU MAY NOT USE THIS SOFTWARE FOR ANY COMMERCIAL PURPOSES WITHOUT BUYING THE PRODUCT

So if you are a represantive of a college (or highschool/club) football team, you have to contact me first at alainsch@buffalo.edu and BUY the product.
Same counts for individuals who compete in a college football league, highschool league or club league.

Therefore I will not provide any instructions on how to install the software.

However, I am looking for testers. 

For prices, testers or other support: alainsch@buffalo.edu
